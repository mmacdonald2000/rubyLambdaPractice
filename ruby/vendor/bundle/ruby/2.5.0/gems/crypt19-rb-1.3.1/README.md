# crypt [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/coffeejunk/crypt19.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/coffeejunk/crypt19) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/coffeejunk/crypt19.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/coffeejunk/crypt19)

## Mirror/Fork

This is a mirror (or fork if you will) of the crypt19 gem. It vanished from
rubygems in February of 2013, which made me a very sad panda. I rescued the
code from my local installation and here it is again..

I will try to continue maintenance, however any help is very welcome!

## Description

The Crypt library is a pure-ruby implementation of a number of popular
encryption algorithms. Block cyphers currently include Blowfish, GOST, IDEA,
Rijndael (AES), and RC6. Cypher Block Chaining (CBC) has been implemented.

Crypt is written entirely in ruby so deployment is simple - no platform
concerns, no library dependencies, nothing to compile.

## Testing

Tests run on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/coffeejunk/crypt19). It
currently is verified to work on the following ruby versions:

* mri 1.8.7
* mri 1.9.3
* jruby 1.8 mode
* rubinius 1.8 mode
* rubinius 1.9 mode

## Installation
    gem install crypt19-rb
